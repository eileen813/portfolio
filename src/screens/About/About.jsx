      <article>As a software engineer with 10+ years as a real estate professional, and a
thorough understanding of company branding, and client satisfaction, I bring
a people-facing perspective to the software engineering industry.  After earning my Associates and
Bachelor's degrees in Information Technology and Health Information Systems,
I pursued a career within the real estate title industry, working first as a
typist/researcher.  I was quickly promoted to several positions of increased
responsibility and decided to obtain my Sales Associate license.  This
experience taught me the importance of great customer service along with
excellent written and verbal communication skills.  As a person who always
wondered what is happening behind the scenes as I input data into a program,
or search for a specific data type, I decided to expand my skill set and
further my education to pursue software engineering.  I graduated from the
full time Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly, where
I developed skills in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, React, and other technical
skills that allowed me to build four projects over the course of the
twelve-week program. This experience, combined with many years in the real
estate industry, helped me learn about problem-solving under pressure, and
within strict timelines.  </article>
